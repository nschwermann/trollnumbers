Troll numbers
===========
'Everyone knows trolls can't even count up to four!'*

*In fact, trolls traditionally count like this: one, two, three, many, and people 
assume this means they can have no grasp of higher numbers. They don't realise 
that many can BE a number. As in: one, two, three, many, many-one, many-two,
many-three, many many, many-many-one, many-many-two, many-many-three, 
many many many, many-many-many-one, many-many-many-two, many-many-three, LOTS

I've read these wonderful lines in [Terry Pratchett]'s [Men at Arms] many years ago 
and while trying to learn different programming languages, I started using them 
as a challenge and as a way to investigate a programming language's different 
aspects by trying to implement them in the language I'm currently learning. 

The projects in this repository are the implementations of those rows in different 
programming languages. 

I've also written an [article] about implementing this project in Kotlin.

If you'd like to implement troll numbers using a different programming language you're welcome to add a PR.
